# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Summary:
The Diabetes Prediction Model is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health metrics. Using a comprehensive dataset from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, the model employs several preprocessing techniques and classification algorithms to accurately forecast diabetes onset.

### Features:
- Data cleaning and normalization to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- A user-friendly interface for inputting patient data and receiving diabetes risk predictions.

### Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

### Usage:
Clone the repository, install the necessary libraries, and execute the script to input patient data and receive a diabetes risk prediction.
