# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Summary:
The Diabetes Prediction Model project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health metrics. Using machine learning techniques, this project helps in early diagnosis and effective management of diabetes.

## Detailed Description:
The project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and involves multiple steps, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

### Features:
- Data cleaning and normalization to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- A user-friendly interface for inputting patient data and receiving diabetes risk predictions.

### Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

### Usage:
Clone the repository, install the necessary libraries, and execute the script to input patient data and receive a diabetes risk prediction.
