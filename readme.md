### Welcome to My Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of my data science and machine learning projects. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. Below are summaries of my key projects:

---

### Fraud Detection Model

**Project Overview:**
This project entails developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions. Using a large dataset of transaction records, the model identifies patterns and anomalies that indicate potential fraud. The project involves extensive data preprocessing and the application of several classification algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of fraud detection algorithms (Isolation Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Model performance metrics (precision, recall, AUC-ROC)
- Visualization of transaction data and fraud detection results

**Technologies:**
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Movie Recommendation Engine (Content Based)

**Project Overview:**
This project involves developing a content-based movie recommendation system. By leveraging movie metadata such as genres, the engine suggests movies that are similar to ones a user likes. The recommendations are generated using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- TF-IDF vectorization of movie genres
- Cosine similarity computation for recommendation
- Easy-to-use interface for movie suggestions

**Technologies:**
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

### Diabetes Prediction Model

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on predicting diabetes in patients using machine learning models. The prediction is based on a variety of health metrics from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The goal is to provide accurate predictions to aid in early diagnosis and treatment.

**Key Features:**
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models
- Model performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- User interface for inputting patient data and receiving predictions

**Technologies:**
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
