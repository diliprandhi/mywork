# Fraud Detection Model

## Summary:
The Fraud Detection Model project is designed to identify potentially fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques. This project is critical for detecting and preventing fraud in financial data.

## Detailed Description:
The project processes a large dataset of financial transactions and employs various techniques to identify anomalies that could indicate fraud. The process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning algorithm.

### Features:

- Data preprocessing including handling of missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Implementation of multiple anomaly detection and classification algorithms such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and Logistic Regression.
- Evaluation of model performance through metrics like precision, recall, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC).
- A dashboard for visualizing transaction data and flagging suspicious activities.

### Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn for algorithm implementation and model evaluation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

### Usage:
Clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the script to analyze transaction data and detect potential fraud.
