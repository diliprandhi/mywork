# Fraud Detection Model
## Summary:
The Fraud Detection Model is an advanced machine learning project designed to identify potentially fraudulent transactions in financial data. Leveraging a dataset of transactions, the model uses various techniques to preprocess the data and apply sophisticated algorithms to detect anomalies indicative of fraud.

### Features:

- Data preprocessing including handling of missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Implementation of multiple anomaly detection and classification algorithms such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and Logistic Regression.
- Evaluation of model performance through metrics like precision, recall, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC).
- A dashboard for visualizing transaction data and flagging suspicious activities.

### Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn for algorithm implementation and model evaluation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

### Usage:
Clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the script to analyze transaction data and detect potential fraud.
