## Zomato Analysis

## Summary:
The Zomato Analysis project undertakes a comprehensive exploration of the Zomato restaurant dataset to derive meaningful insights regarding various factors that influence restaurant ratings and popularity. This analysis aims to provide actionable intelligence for restaurant owners and food enthusiasts to understand trends in the restaurant industry better.

### Detailed Description:
The project begins with extensive data preprocessing. This step involves handling missing values, identifying and addressing outliers, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis. Ensuring data quality is crucial to deriving accurate insights.

Once the dataset is clean, the project moves into the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase. Here, we delve into the dataset to understand distributions and relationships between different variables. Key areas of focus include:

- Location Analysis: Examining the geographical distribution of restaurants, identifying hotspots, and understanding the correlation between location and restaurant ratings.
- Cuisine Popularity: Analyzing the popularity of different cuisines across various regions. This helps in understanding which cuisines are preferred by customers in specific areas.
- Cost Distribution: Investigating the distribution of restaurant costs and its impact on ratings. This involves categorizing restaurants into different cost brackets and examining customer preferences.
- Rating Trends: Studying the distribution of ratings to identify what factors contribute to high or low ratings. This could include aspects like service quality, food quality, and ambiance.

The project employs powerful visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create compelling visual representations of the data. These visualizations make it easier to communicate findings and understand trends.
